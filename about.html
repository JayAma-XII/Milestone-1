      Who are we?
      </h1>
      <p>
        Emerging from the neon-soaked shadows of London’s underground scene, The Graveyard Sirens are a fierce, all-female quartet conjuring sonic spells from the crossroads of Gothic Rock, Darkwave, Punk, and Occult Pop. With bone-rattling riffs, synth-laced sorcery, and vocals that could raise the dead (and seduce them right back into the grave), these sirens don’t sing you to sleep—they scream you awake.

      <img src="assets/images/BandMembers.png" alt="The image features five gothic women standing confidently in a dimly lit setting, likely a promotional band photo for The Graveyard Sirens. Their fashion is dark, elaborate, and distinctly alternative, blending Victorian and punk aesthetics:
        Centre Front: The lead figure wears a black corset dress with a choker and a sheer black veil, holding a black electric guitar. Her expression is intense and commanding, exuding lead vocalist energy.
        To her left: A woman with long dark hair and a choker grips a coffin-shaped bass guitar. Her look is sleek and severe, with a leather outfit and visible tattoo.
        Far left: Another bandmate sports deep auburn curls and a sleeveless leather top, suggesting a gritty, rebellious guitarist or bassist role.
        To the right of the lead: A drummer holds sticks casually, with a velvet black dress and subtle tattoos, projecting a cool and steady energy.
        Far right: A soft but eerie presence with pale blonde curls and a crown of dark roses, likely the synth player or keyboardist, giving off an ethereal, ghostly aura.
        The background is moody and minimal, ensuring all focus stays on their expressions, instruments, and hauntingly beautiful styling.">

        History
      </h1>
      <p>
        Formed in late 2023 in a crumbling Camden squat lit by candles and LED pentagrams, The Graveyard Sirens began as a chaotic jam session between four women united by a love of Bauhaus, Siouxsie, ritual magick, and screaming into the abyss. Within six months, they’d packed out every underground venue worth its salt, leaving behind trails of broken hearts, smudged eyeliner, and a few allegedly haunted guitar picks.

        The band's debut EP, "Witch, Please" (2024), garnered cult status for its blend of snarling punk energy, ghostly harmonies, and lyrics laced with occult symbolism and feminine rage. Their follow-up single, "Hex Rated", was described by critics as “the lovechild of a séance and a riot.”

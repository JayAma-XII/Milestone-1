      Who are we?
      </h1>
      <p>
        Emerging from the neon-soaked shadows of London’s underground scene, The Graveyard Sirens are a fierce, all-female quartet conjuring sonic spells from the crossroads of Gothic Rock, Darkwave, Punk, and Occult Pop. With bone-rattling riffs, synth-laced sorcery, and vocals that could raise the dead (and seduce them right back into the grave), these sirens don’t sing you to sleep—they scream you awake.

        History
      </h1>
      <p>
        Formed in late 2023 in a crumbling Camden squat lit by candles and LED pentagrams, The Graveyard Sirens began as a chaotic jam session between four women united by a love of Bauhaus, Siouxsie, ritual magick, and screaming into the abyss. Within six months, they’d packed out every underground venue worth its salt, leaving behind trails of broken hearts, smudged eyeliner, and a few allegedly haunted guitar picks.

        The band's debut EP, "Witch, Please" (2024), garnered cult status for its blend of snarling punk energy, ghostly harmonies, and lyrics laced with occult symbolism and feminine rage. Their follow-up single, "Hex Rated", was described by critics as “the lovechild of a séance and a riot.”
